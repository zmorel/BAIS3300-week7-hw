Web forms

For this project I was able to create a survey that contains two different pages with informartion.
There were many different aspects including radio buttons, help buttons, and more. There was also a thank you page at the end.


I was able to keep muy site very simple and easy to read. It will make it much easier for people visiting the site to understand what is going on rather than being confused and making their experience difficult. There are many different sections that are clearly and distinctly defined for the user. It is laid out in a way that is very manageable.

I kept my survey appropriate for what people would be expecting. I asked some personal questions like first name and last name along with age and other factors. I wanted to understand the user experience at Iowa and make sure that only Iowa students were answering the question so there is no other bias. I also provided drop down boxes when necessary along with large paragraph boxes so people have plenty of room to respond.


I also made it very clear that the survey was over by including a thank you page. If this was not included some users may be slightly confused if they needed to fill out more. I also think it is important to add this page so people understand I was grateful for them completing it. I know a lot of people may not want to fill out a survey but filling it out for me would be very helpful looking forward with what I was doing with the information
